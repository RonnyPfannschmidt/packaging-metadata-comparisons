# Packaging Metadata Comparions

Get an idea how various packaging systems declare metadata, in an effort to
figure out how pyproject.toml should do it.


## Please help out!

Find any mistakes or misunderstandings? Don’t agree with some observations? Think I should discuss a tool but haven’t? Have insights on a metadata field not yet mentioned?

Please file a pull request!
