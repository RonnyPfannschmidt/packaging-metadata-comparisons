# Packaging Metadata Comparions

Get an idea how various packaging systems declare metadata, in an effort to figure out how pyproject.toml should do it.

## Topics

<!-- To contributors: Do not put anything between topic_gen_start and topic_gen_finish; those are auto-generated by `script/topics_gen.py`. -->

<!-- topics_gen_start -->
* [Dependency Entries](topics/dependency-entries.md)
* [Dependency Grouping](topics/dependency-grouping.md)
* [License](topics/license.md)
* [Version](topics/version.md)
<!-- topics_gen_finish -->

## Please help out!

Find any mistakes or misunderstandings? Don’t agree with some observations? Think I should discuss a tool but haven’t? Have insights on a metadata field not yet mentioned?

Please file a pull request!
