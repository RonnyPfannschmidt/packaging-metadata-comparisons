# Packaging Metadata Comparions

Get an idea how various packaging systems declare metadata, in an effort to
figure out how pyproject.toml should do it.

Some projects that are being looked at for comparison:
- Python
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/)
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io)
  - [Pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org)
  - [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/)
- Other languages
  - [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/)
  - [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)


## Please help out!

Find any mistakes or misunderstandings? Don’t agree with some observations? Think I should discuss a tool but haven’t? Have insights on a metadata field not yet mentioned?

Please file a pull request!
